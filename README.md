##Folders
* "cooking_code" folder : All of the code (and the input) goes here.  We use scikit-learn's implementation of our learning algorithms.

  * cooking_util contains reusable code and is meant to be imported as a module.  It includes:
    * a function that loads the data
    * a function that cleans the data using Elad's cleaning method
    * a class that makes the data into numpy arrays
    * a function that creates a submission file, using a prediction function
  * log_reg.py uses scikit-learn's logistic regression with Elad's cleaning method
  * random_forest.py uses scikit-learn's random forest with Elad's cleaning method
  * log_reg_bag_of_words.py uses scikit-learn's logistic regression with the bag of words cleaning method
  * random_forest_bag_of_words.py uses scikit-learn's random_forest with the bag of words cleaning method

* "cooking_output‚Äù folder : Submission files generated by the algorithms
  * kaggle_scores.txt stores the csv files' accuracies on submission to Kaggle.
